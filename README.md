# 🚀 Resume Screening AI System

This project is an intelligent, AI-powered resume analysis system built using *Flask* and *Machine Learning*. It allows users to upload resumes in PDF or TXT formats and performs:

- 📂 *Resume Categorization* (using ML)
- 💼 *Job Recommendation* (based on predicted category)
- 📊 *Resume Parsing* (Name, Email, Phone, Skills, Education)

> ⚡ Smart, beautiful, and responsive web UI with animations and file preview.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies Used |
|----------|-------------------|
| Backend  | Python, Flask      |
| ML Model | TF-IDF + Random Forest |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Parsing  | pdfminer.six, Regex |
| Deployment Ready | ✅ Yes |

## ✨ Features

- Drag-and-click file upload with file name preview
- Support for .pdf and .txt resume formats
- Displays:
  - 📌 Predicted job category
  - 💡 Recommended job
  - 🧾 Extracted personal info (Name, Email, Phone)
  - 🛠 Skills and 🎓 Education
- Stylish gradient UI with fade and slide animations
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

## 🔧 How It Works

1. *User uploads a resume*
2. *Backend parses the content*
3. *ML model predicts category*
4. *Recommended job is suggested*
5. *Parser extracts key information (name, email, etc.)*
6. *Frontend displays everything cleanly*
